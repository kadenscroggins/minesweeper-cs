# Minesweeper C#
I wanted to redo the [minesweeper game](https://github.com/kadenscroggins/undergrad-code/tree/main/CS-2133-20918/assn5) I made in CSII, but convert it to C# to get more comfortable with the language.

Currently, the game is fully functional but not polished. Additional features I would add to polish it up are getting it set up include:
* Make a game reset refresh the window instead of opening a new one
* Three different difficulty levels, as well as a custom difficulty option
* A counter that displays (expected) remaining mines
  * That is, if mine flagging is implemented
* Mine flagging
* Better icons
